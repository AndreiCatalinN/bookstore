This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.
The backend of the project was generated with express-generator.
## Development server
Requirements for the project: mongo.db, node.js.

In order to run the project run npm install inside the folder with package.json to get the dependencies and then npm start to run the front end.
The same thing needs to be done inside the folder back-end, to install the dependencies for the back-end.
To run the back-end write after starting the mongo database from mongo.exe: node app.js


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Before the first ng server, npm install needs to be performed to download the packages.
## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
